# A note on the fixtures

These were derived from a test repository, and then we replaced all instances of that repository's name with `console` instead, because we want the tests to constrain things to only working on valid WHATWG repositories. So, they might be a bit confusing if you actually try to track down these commits and pull requests on GitHub, since they don't exist.
